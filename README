Star Field Image Generator

This will process the Tycho 2 Star Catalog, and also the Principal Galaxy Catalog
to create an equirectangular image of the things therein.


You will need to download the catalogs yourself, as Tycho, for instance, is about 500 megabytes.

For Tycho, you might try: http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/Cat?target=http&cat=I%2F259&
For the PGC, you might try: http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/Cat?VII/237
(at the moment, I was using an older PGC (VII_119), need to debug with newer)


Usage:
  ./procstars -S 6 -m 12 -s 12 -w 32768
  ./procstars -S 6 -m 12 -s 6 -w 16384
  ./procstars -c Tycho.cat -o stars.tif
  ./procstars --help



It is written in basic C++. You will need GraphicsMagick development files available.
Just "make" and run!
