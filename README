Star Field Image Generator

This will process the Tycho 2 Star Catalog, and also the Principal
Galaxy Catalog to create an equirectangular image of the things therein.


You will need to download the catalogs yourself, as Tycho, for instance,
is about 500 megabytes.

For Tycho, you might try:
   http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/Cat?target=http&cat=I%2F259&
For the PGC, you might try:
   http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/Cat?VII/119




Usage:
  ./procstars -S 6 -m 12 -s 12 -w 32768
  ./procstars -S 6 -m 12 -s 6 -w 16384
  ./procstars -c Tycho.cat -o stars.tif
  ./procstars --help



It is written in basic C++. You will need GraphicsMagick development files
available. Just "make" and run!



TODO:
Apparently, there is a newer galaxy catalog, but haven't coded for it yet:
  http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/Cat?VII/237
What the heck are those giant red splotches in the sky?? need to approximate
Fake big things like LMC and SMC?
